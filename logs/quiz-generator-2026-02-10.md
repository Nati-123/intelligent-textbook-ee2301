## Session 3: Units 1-6 (Regeneration)

### Units processed: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

### Reason for Regeneration
The original Units 1-6 quizzes had a severe B-heavy answer distribution bias:
- Original totals: A=4, B=29, C=18, D=9 (48% B answers)
- Additionally, Units 2-6 had zero A answers combined

### Content Readiness
| Unit | Title | Word Count | Concepts | Readiness Score |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Number Systems | ~6,100 | 40 | 80/100 |
| 2 | Boolean Algebra | ~7,800 | 50 | 85/100 |
| 3 | Applications of Boolean Algebra | ~6,200 | 35 | 80/100 |
| 4 | Minterm & Maxterm Expansions | ~7,500 | 35 | 80/100 |
| 5 | Karnaugh Maps | ~8,200 | 40 | 85/100 |
| 6 | Quine-McCluskey Method | ~9,100 | 25 | 80/100 |

All units well above 60/100 threshold.

### Chapter Classification
- **Units 1-3:** Foundational (first 3 of 13)
- **Units 4-6:** Foundational-Intermediate (units 4-6 of 13)

2. **Question quality:** More detailed explanations with distractor analysis
3. **Overflow detection (Unit 1 Q4):** Changed to general carry-in vs carry-out XOR method instead of the narrower "result is negative" test
4. **Fan-out (Unit 2 Q9):** Upgraded from simple recall to scenario-based application question
5. **Magnitude comparator (Unit 3 Q10):** Upgraded to analyze-level question asking about the mathematical principle
