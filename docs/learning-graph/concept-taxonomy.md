## Category Descriptions

### FOUND - Foundation Concepts
Core concepts that introduce the digital world, including the distinction between analog and digital systems, and fundamental terminology like bits, bytes, and words.

### NUMSYS - Number Systems
The four primary number systems (decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal) and their properties including positional notation and base concepts.

### CONV - Number Conversions
All techniques for converting numbers between different bases, including direct conversion methods and shortcuts.

### ARITH - Binary Arithmetic
Mathematical operations in binary including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and signed number representations (sign-magnitude, 1's complement, 2's complement).

### BOOLF - Boolean Fundamentals
Introduction to Boolean algebra including variables, constants, truth values, and the three basic operations (AND, OR, NOT).

### GATES - Logic Gates
Physical implementations of Boolean operations as electronic gates, including basic gates (AND, OR, NOT), derived gates (NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR), and gate characteristics.

### THEOR - Boolean Theorems
The mathematical laws and theorems of Boolean algebra including identity, null, idempotent, commutative, associative, distributive, absorption, and DeMorgan's theorems.

### FORMS - Boolean Forms
Different ways to express Boolean functions including literals, product terms, sum terms, SOP, POS, and expression simplification.

### COMB - Combinational Circuits
Design and analysis of combinational logic circuits, including specification-to-circuit translation and word problem conversion.

### ACIR - Arithmetic Circuits
Specific circuit implementations for arithmetic operations including half/full adders, half/full subtractors, ripple carry adders, comparators, and parity circuits.

### CANON - Canonical Forms
Minterms, maxterms, canonical SOP and POS forms, sigma and pi notation, don't care conditions, and function representations.

### KMAP - Karnaugh Maps
K-map structure and techniques for visual simplification of Boolean expressions, including grouping rules, prime implicants, and optimization strategies.
