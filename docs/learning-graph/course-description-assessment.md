## Strengths

- Excellent Bloom's Taxonomy coverage with specific, actionable outcomes at all 6 levels
- Comprehensive 13-unit structure covering foundations through advanced topics
- Well-structured topics with clear unit organization and logical progression
- Good prerequisite and audience identification
- Assessment methods and course format clearly described
- Topics progress logically: foundations → minimization → implementation → sequential → advanced

## Course Structure

| Part | Units | Topics |
|------|-------|--------|
| I: Foundations | 1-3 | Number systems, Boolean algebra, applications |
| II: Minimization | 4-6 | Canonical forms, K-maps, Quine-McCluskey |
| III: Implementation | 7-8 | Multi-level gates, combinational modules |
| IV: Sequential Logic | 9-10 | Fundamentals, circuit design |
| V: Advanced Topics | 11-13 | PLDs, VHDL, system integration |

## Concept Estimate

Based on all 13 units, approximately **400 concepts** can be derived:

| Unit | Topic | Estimated Concepts |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| Unit 1 | Number Systems | ~40 |
| Unit 2 | Boolean Algebra | ~50 |
| Unit 3 | Applications of Boolean Algebra | ~35 |
| Unit 4 | Minterm/Maxterm Expansions | ~35 |
| Unit 5 | Karnaugh Maps | ~40 |
| Unit 6 | Quine-McCluskey Method | ~25 |
| Unit 7 | Multi-Level Gate Circuits | ~20 |
| Unit 8 | Combinational Logic Modules | ~25 |
| Unit 9 | Sequential Logic Fundamentals | ~30 |
| Unit 10 | Sequential Circuit Design | ~30 |
| Unit 11 | Programmable Logic Devices | ~30 |
| Unit 12 | Introduction to VHDL | ~25 |
| Unit 13 | System Integration | ~15 |

**Total Estimate:** ~400 concepts

This is comparable to similar digital logic courses at the undergraduate level.

## Areas for Minor Improvement

- Could add a "Topics NOT Covered" section to set explicit boundaries (e.g., analog circuit design, ASIC fabrication, advanced verification)
- Learning outcomes could be expanded to explicitly address VHDL and FPGA topics added in later units

## Recommendation

**APPROVED** — The course description quality score of 98/100 exceeds the 70-point threshold. All 13 units are fully developed with comprehensive content, quizzes, practice problems, challenge problems, references, and narration scripts. Proceed with continued learning graph development.
