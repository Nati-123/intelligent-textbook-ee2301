**Total: 95/100**

## Strengths

- Excellent Bloom's Taxonomy coverage with specific, actionable outcomes at all 6 levels
- Well-structured topics with clear unit organization
- Good prerequisite and audience identification
- Assessment methods and course format clearly described
- Topics progress logically from foundations to applications

## Areas for Minor Improvement

- Add a "Topics NOT Covered" section to set clear boundaries (e.g., "This course does not cover sequential logic, flip-flops, or state machines")
- Could expand planned units to ensure full 200 concepts

## Concept Estimate

Based on the 5 current units + 2 planned units, approximately **150-200 concepts** can be derived:

| Unit | Estimated Concepts |
|------|-------------------|
| Number Systems | ~35 |
| Boolean Algebra | ~45 |
| Applications of Boolean Algebra | ~30 |
| Minterm/Maxterm Expansions | ~25 |
| Karnaugh Maps | ~40 |
| Quine-McCluskey Method | ~15 |
| Multi-Level Gate Circuits | ~10 |

**Total Estimate:** ~200 concepts

This is comparable to similar digital logic courses at the undergraduate level.

## Recommendation

**APPROVED** - The course description quality score of 95/100 exceeds the 70-point threshold. Proceed with learning graph generation.
