# Counter Simulator

An interactive 4-bit binary counter demonstrating up/down counting.

## Overview

This MicroSim shows how a synchronous binary counter increments or decrements through all 16 states (0-15).

## Learning Objectives

- **Understand** counter operation and state sequences (Bloom Level: L2)
- **Apply** counters for timing and sequencing applications (Bloom Level: L3)

## How to Use

1. **Click "Count Up"** to increment the counter
2. **Click "Count Down"** to decrement the counter
3. **Use "Auto Count"** for continuous counting
4. **Observe** the binary state changes

## Running the MicroSim
