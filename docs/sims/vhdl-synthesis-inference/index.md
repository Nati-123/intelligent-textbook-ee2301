## Description

This simulation shows how VHDL synthesis tools infer hardware from code patterns. Select from six common code patterns to see the VHDL code alongside the hardware circuit that gets synthesized.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Understand (L2)

- Recognize which hardware structures are inferred from VHDL patterns
- Match concurrent assignments to combinational logic
- Identify process patterns that infer flip-flops and latches
- Understand the difference between intended and unintended inference

## How to Use

1. Click a **pattern button** to select a VHDL code pattern
2. View the **VHDL code** on the left side
3. See the **inferred hardware** diagram on the right side
4. Read the **explanation** of why that hardware is inferred
5. Note the **warning** for unintended latch inference
