## Description

Learn Boolean expression simplification through step-by-step examples. Each step shows the rule applied and the resulting expression.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Apply (L3)

- Apply Boolean algebra laws to simplify expressions
- Identify which rule to apply at each step
- Follow multi-step simplification processes

## Examples Included

1. **AB + AB'** → A (using complement and identity)
2. **A + AB** → A (using absorption)
3. **(A + B)(A + B')** → A (using FOIL and complement)
4. **A'B + AB + AB'** → A + B
5. **(A + B)'** → A'B' (De Morgan's)

## How to Use

1. Select an example expression from the dropdown
2. Click "Next" to reveal each simplification step
3. Study the rule applied at each step
4. Click "Previous" to review earlier steps
