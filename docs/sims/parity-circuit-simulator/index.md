## Description

Explore parity generation and checking circuits used for error detection in data transmission. Learn how XOR trees compute parity bits.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Apply (L3)

- Apply parity generation algorithms
- Detect single-bit errors using parity
- Distinguish between even and odd parity

## Parity Types

### Even Parity
- Total number of 1s (data + parity) is even
- XOR of all bits = 0 means no error

### Odd Parity
- Total number of 1s (data + parity) is odd
- XOR of all bits = 1 means no error

## How to Use

1. Select Generate or Check mode
2. Choose Even or Odd parity type
3. Click data bits to toggle (0/1)
4. In Check mode, also toggle the parity bit
5. Observe the parity calculation and error detection
