## Description

This interactive walkthrough demonstrates how to convert a Sum-of-Products (SOP) circuit to an equivalent all-NAND implementation using the bubble pushing technique. Starting with F = AB + CD in AND-OR form, it shows the double inversion method and De Morgan's theorem application.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Apply (L3)

- Apply the double inversion technique for NAND conversion
- Use De Morgan's theorem for bubble pushing
- Convert any 2-level AND-OR circuit to NAND-NAND
- Verify equivalence of converted circuits

## How to Use

1. Click **Next →** to advance through each conversion step
2. Watch the AND-OR circuit transform step by step
3. See bubbles being added and absorbed into gates
4. Observe the final all-NAND circuit
5. Click **← Previous** to review earlier steps
6. Click **Reset** to start over
