## Description

This MicroSim demonstrates the fundamental difference between analog (continuous) and digital (discrete) signals. Adjust the noise level to see how digital signals maintain their integrity while analog signals become corrupted.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Understand (L2)

- Compare continuous analog signals with discrete digital signals
- Explain why digital signals are more noise-resistant
- Identify real-world examples of each signal type

## How to Use

1. Observe both signal types side by side
2. Adjust the noise slider to add interference
3. Notice how digital signals remain interpretable despite noise
