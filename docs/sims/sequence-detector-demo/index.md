# Sequence Detector Demo

An interactive "101" sequence detector demonstrating pattern recognition in serial data.

## Overview

This MicroSim shows a Moore FSM that detects the bit pattern "101" in a serial input stream, with overlapping detection supported.

## Learning Objectives

- **Apply** FSM design to sequence detection problems (Bloom Level: L3)
- **Analyze** overlapping pattern detection (Bloom Level: L4)

## How to Use

1. **Click "Input 0"** or **"Input 1"** to enter bits
2. **Watch** the state transitions
3. **See** when "101" is detected (output = 1)
4. **Notice** overlapping detection after finding "101"
