## Description

This interactive walkthrough demonstrates the Quine-McCluskey method for systematic Boolean function minimization. It shows grouping by 1-count, combining adjacent terms, building the prime implicant chart, and selecting essential prime implicants.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Apply (L3)

- Apply the Quine-McCluskey algorithm step by step
- Group minterms by number of 1s in binary representation
- Combine terms that differ in exactly one bit
- Build and analyze a prime implicant chart
- Identify essential prime implicants

## How to Use

1. Click **Next →** to advance through each QM step
2. Watch minterms being grouped and combined
3. See the prime implicant chart being built
4. Observe essential PIs being identified
5. Click **← Previous** to review earlier steps
6. Click **Reset** to start over
