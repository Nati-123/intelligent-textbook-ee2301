Interactive AND gate demonstration showing the gate symbol, clickable inputs, and a complete truth table with the current state highlighted.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to explain the behavior of an AND gate and predict its output for any combination of inputs.

## Bloom Level

Understand (L2) - Explain, demonstrate

## Features

- AND gate symbol with input/output wires
- Two clickable toggle buttons to set inputs A and B
- Truth table with current input combination highlighted
- Live Boolean expression evaluation (A &middot; B = Y)
- Key insight box reinforcing the AND gate rule

## Usage

Click the toggle boxes next to inputs A and B to change their values between 0 and 1. The gate output and truth table highlight update in real time.

## Lesson Plan

1. Start with both inputs at 0 - observe output is 0
2. Toggle A to 1 - output remains 0 (both inputs must be 1)
3. Toggle B to 1 - output becomes 1 (both inputs are now 1)
4. Toggle A back to 0 - output returns to 0
5. Discuss: AND requires ALL inputs HIGH for HIGH output
