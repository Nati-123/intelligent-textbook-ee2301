## Description

This simulation illustrates the complete FPGA design flow from initial specification through deployment. It shows all 10 major steps including feedback loops for design iteration when timing or functional requirements are not met.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Remember (L1)

- List the major steps in the FPGA design flow
- Identify the order of design, synthesis, and implementation steps
- Recognize where feedback loops occur in the flow
- Understand the role of each step in producing a working design

## How to Use

1. Click on any step box to see its detailed description
2. Observe the forward flow (green arrows) and feedback loops (red arrows)
3. Click **Animate** to watch a signal trace through the entire flow
4. Selected step shows detailed description in the info panel
