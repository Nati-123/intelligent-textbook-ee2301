## Description

This interactive walkthrough demonstrates the repeated division method for converting decimal number 156 to binary (base 2), octal (base 8), and hexadecimal (base 16). Each division step is animated with a visual table showing dividends, quotients, and remainders.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Apply (L3)

- Apply the repeated division algorithm for base conversion
- Trace through division steps collecting remainders
- Read remainders in reverse order to form the converted number
- Convert between decimal and binary, octal, and hexadecimal

## How to Use

1. Click **Next →** to advance through each division step
2. Watch the division table build up row by row
3. Observe how remainders are collected and read bottom-to-top
4. Click **← Previous** to review earlier steps
5. Click **Reset** to start over
