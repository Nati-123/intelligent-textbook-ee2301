## Description

This simulation demonstrates a Programmable Logic Array (PLA) with both programmable AND and OR arrays. Click crosspoint connections to define product terms and sum-of-products outputs.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Apply (L3)

- Configure product terms in the AND array
- Connect product terms to outputs in the OR array
- Evaluate PLA outputs for given inputs
- Understand the two-level AND-OR structure

## How to Use

1. Set inputs **A, B, C** by clicking their toggle buttons
2. Click crosspoints in the **AND array** to include/exclude literals
3. Click crosspoints in the **OR array** to connect product terms to outputs
4. Click **Evaluate** to compute outputs based on current inputs
5. Observe which product terms activate and which outputs go high
