<iframe src="main.html" height="640px" width="100%" scrolling="no"></iframe>


## Description

This interactive walkthrough demonstrates Karnaugh Map simplification for a 4-variable Boolean function. It shows how to fill the K-map from a minterm list, identify groups of adjacent 1s (including wrap-around groups), and extract the simplified SOP expression.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Apply (L3)

- Apply K-map grouping rules to simplify Boolean functions
- Identify valid groups including wrap-around adjacencies
- Extract product terms from K-map groups
- Combine group terms into a minimum SOP expression

## How to Use

1. Click **Next →** to advance through each simplification step
2. Watch the K-map being filled with 1s from the minterm list
3. See groups highlighted with colored outlines
4. Observe how variables are eliminated within each group
5. Click **← Previous** to review earlier steps
6. Click **Reset** to start over
