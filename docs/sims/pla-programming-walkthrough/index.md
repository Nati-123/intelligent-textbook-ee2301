## Description

This interactive walkthrough demonstrates how to program a Programmable Logic Array (PLA) to implement two Boolean functions: F1 = AB + A'C and F2 = AB + BC. It shows how product terms are shared across outputs via the AND and OR planes.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Apply (L3)

- Apply PLA programming techniques to implement Boolean functions
- Trace signal flow through AND and OR crosspoint planes
- Understand product term sharing between multiple outputs
- Verify PLA output correctness with test inputs

## How to Use

1. Click **Next →** to advance through each programming step
2. Watch the AND plane crosspoints being configured for each product term
3. See the OR plane connections routing product terms to outputs
4. Verify the result by tracing a test input through the PLA
5. Click **← Previous** to review earlier steps
6. Click **Reset** to start over
