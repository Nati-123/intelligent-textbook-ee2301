## Description

This interactive walkthrough demonstrates a step-by-step proof of the Absorption Law (A + AB = A) using fundamental Boolean algebra theorems. Each step shows the algebraic transformation and identifies the law being applied.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Apply (L3)

- Apply Boolean algebra laws to prove theorems
- Identify which Boolean law justifies each simplification step
- Trace through multi-step algebraic proofs
- Understand the Absorption Law and its proof

## How to Use

1. Click **Next →** to advance through each proof step
2. Observe how the expression transforms at each step
3. Note the law/rule label identifying the Boolean algebra law used
4. Click **← Previous** to review earlier steps
5. Click **Reset** to start over
