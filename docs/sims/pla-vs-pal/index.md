## Description

This simulation provides a side-by-side comparison of PLA (Programmable Logic Array) and PAL (Programmable Array Logic) architectures, highlighting the key difference: PLA has both arrays programmable while PAL has a fixed OR array.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Analyze (L4)

- Compare PLA and PAL architectures side by side
- Identify which arrays are programmable vs fixed
- Analyze the trade-offs between flexibility and speed
- Understand why PAL is faster but less flexible than PLA

## How to Use

1. Toggle inputs **A, B** to see how both architectures evaluate
2. Click crosspoints in programmable arrays (marked with X)
3. Notice the PAL OR array connections are **fixed** (cannot be changed)
4. Compare the structural differences between the two devices
