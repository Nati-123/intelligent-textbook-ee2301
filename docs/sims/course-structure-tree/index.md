## Description

This MicroSim provides an interactive hierarchical tree diagram that visualizes the complete structure of the EE2301 Digital System Design course. It serves as a navigational aid and course overview, helping students understand the organization of all course materials including units, content pages, quizzes, references, MicroSims, and supplemental resources.

The tree starts from a root node and branches into all major sections of the textbook. Each node can be expanded or collapsed to reveal or hide its children, allowing students to drill down into specific areas of interest or get a high-level overview of the entire course. Color coding distinguishes different content types at a glance.

Key features include:

- Expandable/collapsible tree nodes for all course content
- Color-coded node types: purple for units, green for content, orange for quizzes, teal for references, pink for MicroSims, gray for resources
- Expand All and Collapse All buttons for quick navigation
- Scrollable view for exploring the full tree structure
- Summary statistics showing total units and MicroSims count

## Iframe Embedding

You can include this MicroSim on your website using the following `iframe`:

```

## How to Use

1. Observe the root node of the course structure tree at the top of the display.
2. Click on any node that has children (indicated by a small arrow or plus symbol) to **expand** it and reveal its sub-items.
3. Click on an expanded node again to **collapse** it and hide its children.
4. Use the **Expand All** button to open every node in the tree and see the complete course structure.
5. Use the **Collapse All** button to return to a compact overview.
6. Scroll with the mouse wheel to navigate through the tree when it extends beyond the visible area.
7. Note the color coding to quickly identify content types (units, quizzes, MicroSims, etc.).

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Understand (L2)

After using this MicroSim, students will be able to:

- Describe the overall organization of the EE2301 Digital System Design course and its major units
- Navigate efficiently through the textbook structure to locate specific topics, quizzes, or simulations
- Identify the available learning resources for each unit, including content pages, quizzes, references, and MicroSims

## Lesson Plan

### Before the Simulation (5 minutes)
- Introduce the scope of the EE2301 course and its major topic areas
- Explain that the course covers everything from number systems to FSM design and system integration
- Ask students: "How do you typically navigate a textbook to find what you need?"

### During the Simulation (15 minutes)
1. Click Expand All to see the complete course structure
2. Identify the 10 units and read through their titles to understand the course progression
3. Expand a single unit to see its content pages, quizzes, references, and associated MicroSims
4. Count the MicroSims available for a specific unit of interest
5. Use Collapse All and then selectively expand only the units relevant to the current week's material
6. Have students identify which unit covers their current topic and list its available resources

### After the Simulation (5 minutes)
- Discuss how the course builds from foundational topics (number systems, Boolean algebra) to advanced ones (FSMs, system integration)
- Encourage students to use the tree as a study planning tool before exams
- Point out the supplemental resources (FAQ, glossary, learning graph) available outside the unit structure
