<iframe src="main.html" height="520px" width="100%" scrolling="no" style="border:none; border-radius:8px; overflow:hidden;"></iframe>

## Description

This interactive decision tree helps you select the most appropriate programmable logic device (SPLD, CPLD, or FPGA) based on design requirements. Answer questions about complexity, speed, and features to arrive at a recommendation.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Evaluate (L5)

- Evaluate design requirements to select appropriate PLD type
- Compare capabilities of SPLD, CPLD, and FPGA
- Apply selection criteria including gate count, speed, and I/O needs
- Justify PLD selection based on project constraints

## How to Use

1. Start at the **root question** at the top of the tree
2. Click **Yes** or **No** to answer each decision question
3. Follow the highlighted path through the tree
4. Arrive at a **device recommendation** with justification
5. Click **Reset** to start over with different requirements
