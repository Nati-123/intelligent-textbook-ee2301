## Description

This simulation demonstrates the relationship between VHDL entity declarations (the external interface) and architecture bodies (the internal implementation). Click between entity and architecture views to understand the black-box abstraction.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Understand (L2)

- Distinguish between entity (interface) and architecture (implementation)
- Identify port declarations with direction and type
- Understand how one entity can have multiple architectures
- Recognize the black-box abstraction concept

## How to Use

1. Click **Entity View** to see the black-box with port declarations
2. Click **Architecture View** to see the internal implementation
3. Hover over ports to see their VHDL declarations
4. Toggle between example components (AND gate, MUX, Counter)
