## Description

This simulation shows the internal architecture of a Read-Only Memory (ROM) with a 3-input address decoder and programmable OR array. Set address inputs to see which word line activates and which output bits are produced.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Understand (L2)

- Understand ROM structure with decoder and OR array
- Trace address decoding to word line selection
- See how stored data appears at ROM outputs
- Recognize ROM as a fixed AND array with programmable OR array

## How to Use

1. Click the address inputs **A2, A1, A0** to toggle between 0 and 1
2. Watch the decoder select the corresponding word line
3. See which OR-plane connections produce the output bits
4. Click connections in the OR array to program the ROM contents
