## Description

This simulation shows the architecture of a Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD) with multiple function blocks connected through a global interconnect matrix. Click on components to see their internal details.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Understand (L2)

- Identify the main components of a CPLD
- Understand the role of function blocks
- See how the interconnect matrix routes signals
- Recognize I/O blocks at the device periphery

## How to Use

1. Click on any **Function Block** to see its internal structure
2. Click on the **Interconnect Matrix** to see routing details
3. Click on **I/O Blocks** to see pin connections
4. Observe how signals flow from inputs through FBs to outputs
