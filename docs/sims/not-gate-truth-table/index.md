# NOT Gate with Truth Table

<iframe src="main.html" height="480px" width="100%" scrolling="no"></iframe>

[Run Fullscreen](./main.html){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

Interactive NOT gate (inverter) demonstration showing the gate symbol with inversion bubble, a clickable input, and a complete truth table with the current state highlighted.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to explain the behavior of a NOT gate and predict its output for any input value.

## Bloom Level

Understand (L2) - Explain, demonstrate

## Features

- NOT gate symbol (triangle with inversion bubble) and input/output wires
- Single clickable toggle button to set input A
- Two-row truth table with current input highlighted
- Live Boolean expression evaluation (A' = Y)
- Key insight box reinforcing the inversion concept and bubble notation

## Usage

Click the toggle box next to input A to change its value between 0 and 1. The gate output and truth table highlight update in real time.

## Lesson Plan

1. Start with input at 0 - observe output is 1 (inverted)
2. Toggle A to 1 - output becomes 0 (inverted)
3. Toggle back and forth to reinforce: NOT always flips the value
4. Point out the bubble symbol at the output indicating inversion
5. Discuss: NOT is the simplest gate with only one input
