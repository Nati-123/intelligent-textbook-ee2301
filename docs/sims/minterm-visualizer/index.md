## Description

Explore the relationship between minterms (product terms) and maxterms (sum terms). See how each minterm number maps to a specific combination of literals.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Understand (L2)

- Explain the structure of minterms and maxterms
- Convert between minterm index and literal expression
- Understand the duality between minterms and maxterms

## Key Concepts

### Minterm (m)
- **Product (AND) of literals**
- Variable appears uncomplemented when bit = 1
- Variable appears complemented when bit = 0
- Equals 1 for exactly one input combination

### Maxterm (M)
- **Sum (OR) of literals**
- Variable appears complemented when bit = 1
- Variable appears uncomplemented when bit = 0
- Equals 0 for exactly one input combination

## How to Use

1. Select the number of variables (2, 3, or 4)
2. Use the slider or click buttons to select a minterm
3. Observe the binary representation
4. Compare the minterm and maxterm expressions
