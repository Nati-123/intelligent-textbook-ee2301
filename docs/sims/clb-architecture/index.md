## Description

This simulation shows the internal architecture of a Configurable Logic Block (CLB) found in modern FPGAs. It includes two 4-input LUTs, two flip-flops, multiplexers, and a carry chain, demonstrating how these elements work together.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Analyze (L4)

- Identify the components within a CLB
- Trace signal paths through LUTs, MUXes, and flip-flops
- Understand the role of the carry chain for arithmetic
- Analyze how CLB configuration bits control routing

## How to Use

1. Click on **LUT**, **FF**, **MUX**, or **Carry** components to select them
2. View detailed information about the selected component
3. Toggle the **bypass MUX** to route LUT output directly or through the flip-flop
4. Observe signal flow highlighted through the CLB
