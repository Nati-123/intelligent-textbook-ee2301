## Description

This simulation compares the two main FPGA configuration approaches: SRAM-based (requires external configuration on every power-up) and Flash-based (retains configuration without external memory). Click through the steps of each process.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Understand (L2)

- Compare SRAM and Flash FPGA configuration methods
- Understand the boot sequence for SRAM-based FPGAs
- Identify advantages of instant-on Flash configuration
- Recognize trade-offs between the two approaches

## How to Use

1. Click **SRAM** or **Flash** tab to view each configuration flow
2. Click **Next Step** to advance through the configuration process
3. Compare the number of steps and requirements for each approach
4. Read the comparison summary at the bottom
