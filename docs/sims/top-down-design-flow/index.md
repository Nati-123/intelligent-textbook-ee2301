## Description

This simulation illustrates the top-down design methodology for digital systems. Starting from system-level specifications, the design is progressively decomposed through six hierarchical levels with verification feedback loops at each stage.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Understand (L2)

- Describe the six steps of top-down design methodology
- Understand hierarchical decomposition of complex systems
- Identify verification feedback loops at each design level
- Recognize the importance of specification-driven design

## How to Use

1. Click on any **design step** to see its details
2. Observe the **forward flow** (blue arrows) and **verification feedback** (red arrows)
3. Click **Animate** to watch the design progress through all stages
4. Read the description panel for each step's key activities
