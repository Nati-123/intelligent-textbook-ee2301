## Description

Compare how the same decimal value is represented in three different signed number systems. See why two's complement is the preferred method for modern computers.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Analyze (L4)

- Compare sign-magnitude, one's complement, and two's complement
- Explain the "two zeros" problem in sign-magnitude and one's complement
- Justify why two's complement is preferred for arithmetic hardware

## How to Use

1. Use the slider to select a value from -7 to +7
2. Observe how each representation encodes the same value
3. Compare the properties in the table below
