## Description

This interactive simulation demonstrates the four main programmable connection technologies used in PLDs. Each panel shows how the connection works, its default state, and how it gets programmed.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Understand (L2)

- Identify the four programmable connection technologies
- Compare default states of fuse vs antifuse
- Understand volatile vs non-volatile storage
- Distinguish SRAM-based and flash-based connections

## How to Use

1. Click on each of the four connection panels to select it
2. Click **Toggle** to program/unprogram the connection
3. Compare how each technology stores its connection state
4. Observe which connections are volatile vs non-volatile
