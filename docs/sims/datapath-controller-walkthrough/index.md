## Description

This capstone walkthrough demonstrates the complete datapath-controller design methodology: specify operations, design the datapath with registers and ALU, identify control signals, design the controller FSM, and trace a full operation sequence (Load A, Load B, Add, Display).

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Apply (L3)

- Apply the datapath-controller partitioning methodology
- Identify control signals needed for register transfers
- Design a controller FSM that sequences datapath operations
- Trace a complete operation through the integrated system

## How to Use

1. Click **Next →** to advance through each design step
2. Watch the datapath components being assembled
3. See control signals identified and mapped to FSM states
4. Trace a full operation: Load A → Load B → Add → Display
5. Click **← Previous** to review earlier steps
6. Click **Reset** to start over
