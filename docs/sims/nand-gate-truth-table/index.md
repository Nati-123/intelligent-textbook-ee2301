# NAND Gate with Truth Table

Interactive NAND gate demonstration showing the AND-shaped gate symbol with inversion bubble, clickable inputs, and a complete truth table with the current state highlighted.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to explain the behavior of a NAND gate, predict its output for any combination of inputs, and recognize NAND as a universal gate.

## Bloom Level

Understand (L2) - Explain, demonstrate

## Features

- NAND gate symbol (AND shape with inversion bubble) and input/output wires
- Two clickable toggle buttons to set inputs A and B
- Truth table with current input combination highlighted
- Live Boolean expression evaluation ((A · B)' = Y)
- Key insight box reinforcing that NAND is a universal gate

## Usage

Click the toggle boxes next to inputs A and B to change their values between 0 and 1. The gate output and truth table highlight update in real time.

## Lesson Plan

1. Start with both inputs at 0 - observe output is 1 (inverted AND)
2. Toggle A to 1 - output remains 1
3. Toggle B to 1 - output becomes 0 (both inputs HIGH is the only case producing 0)
4. Compare with AND gate: NAND output is always the opposite of AND
5. Discuss: NAND is universal - any logic function can be built from NANDs alone
