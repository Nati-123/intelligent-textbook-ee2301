## Description

This interactive walkthrough demonstrates how to trace the output of a positive-edge-triggered D flip-flop given clock and data input waveforms. Each rising clock edge is highlighted as Q samples the D input value.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Apply (L3)

- Apply D flip-flop timing analysis at rising clock edges
- Trace Q output given CLK and D waveforms
- Understand edge-triggered vs level-sensitive behavior
- Read and construct timing diagrams

## How to Use

1. Click **Next →** to advance through each clock edge
2. Watch the rising edge markers highlight each sampling point
3. See Q update to match D at each rising edge
4. Observe that Q holds its value between edges
5. Click **← Previous** to review earlier steps
6. Click **Reset** to start over
