## Description

Learn the complete digital design flow from problem specification through circuit implementation and verification.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Understand (L2)

- Explain each step in the digital design process
- Describe the purpose of truth tables and Boolean expressions
- Understand the relationship between specification and implementation

## Design Steps

1. **Problem Specification** - Define requirements in plain language
2. **Truth Table** - List all input/output combinations
3. **Boolean Expression** - Derive SOP or POS expression
4. **Simplification** - Minimize the expression
5. **Gate Implementation** - Draw the circuit
6. **Verification** - Test against requirements

## How to Use

1. Click on any step box to view its details
2. Use Previous/Next buttons to navigate
3. Study the example provided for each step
4. Follow the arrows to understand the flow
