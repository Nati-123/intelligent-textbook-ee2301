## Description

This interactive walkthrough bridges state diagrams to VHDL code by implementing a "101" sequence detector as a Moore FSM. Each step builds a VHDL construct: type declaration, state register, next-state logic, and output logic.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Apply (L3)

- Apply VHDL coding patterns for finite state machines
- Translate a state diagram into VHDL processes
- Understand the separation of sequential and combinational logic in FSMs
- Verify FSM behavior by tracing an input sequence

## How to Use

1. Click **Next →** to advance through each VHDL coding step
2. Watch the state diagram translate into VHDL constructs
3. See the state register, next-state, and output processes build up
4. Verify by tracing the input sequence 1-0-1 through the FSM
5. Click **← Previous** to review earlier steps
6. Click **Reset** to start over
