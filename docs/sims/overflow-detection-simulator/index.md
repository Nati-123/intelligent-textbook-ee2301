## Description

Explore how overflow occurs in signed binary arithmetic. See when adding or subtracting two's complement numbers produces incorrect results due to the limited range of representation.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Analyze (L4)

- Detect overflow conditions in signed arithmetic
- Explain why overflow occurs when result exceeds representable range
- Apply overflow detection rules for addition and subtraction

## How to Use

1. Select addition or subtraction operation
2. Adjust Value A and Value B sliders
3. Observe when the result overflows the 4-bit range
4. Study the overflow detection rules shown below
