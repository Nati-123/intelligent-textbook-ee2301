## Description

Learn the bidirectional relationship between Boolean expressions and logic circuits. Practice analyzing circuits to derive expressions and synthesizing circuits from given expressions.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Evaluate (L5)

- Analyze logic circuits to derive Boolean expressions
- Synthesize logic circuits from Boolean expressions
- Evaluate different circuit implementations for the same function

## Modes

### Analysis Mode
Given a circuit diagram, derive the Boolean expression:
1. Identify each gate's function
2. Write intermediate expressions
3. Combine to get final expression

### Synthesis Mode
Given a Boolean expression, design the circuit:
1. Identify required operations
2. Determine needed gates
3. Connect gates appropriately

## How to Use

1. Select Analysis or Synthesis mode
2. Navigate through examples with Previous/Next buttons
3. Study the process for each example
4. Note the relationship between expressions and gates
