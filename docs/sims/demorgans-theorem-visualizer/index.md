# De Morgan's Theorem Visualizer

<iframe src="main.html" height="550px" width="100%" scrolling="no"></iframe>


## Description

Visualize De Morgan's theorems showing how NAND and NOR gates can be represented as OR and AND gates with inverted inputs. Toggle inputs to verify both forms produce the same output.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Analyze (L4)

- Compare equivalent circuit implementations
- Apply De Morgan's theorem to gate transformations
- Verify theorem by testing all input combinations

## De Morgan's Theorems

1. **(A · B)' = A' + B'**: A NAND gate equals an OR gate with inverted inputs
2. **(A + B)' = A' · B'**: A NOR gate equals an AND gate with inverted inputs

## How to Use

1. Select which theorem to visualize
2. Click the A and B toggles to change inputs
3. Observe that both circuits produce the same output
4. Verify for all four input combinations
