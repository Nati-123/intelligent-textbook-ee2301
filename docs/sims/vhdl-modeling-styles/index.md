# VHDL Modeling Styles

## Description

This simulation shows three ways to describe the same circuit in VHDL: dataflow (concurrent signal assignments), structural (component instantiation), and behavioral (process statements). Compare how each approach describes a 2-to-1 multiplexer.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Analyze (L4)

- Compare the three VHDL modeling styles
- Identify when to use each modeling approach
- Analyze how the same function maps to different descriptions
- Understand the relationship between style and abstraction level

## How to Use

1. View all three columns showing the same circuit described differently
2. Click on a **column header** to expand that style's details
3. Toggle inputs **A, B, Sel** to see how each model evaluates
4. Observe that all three produce identical outputs
