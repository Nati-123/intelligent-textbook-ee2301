# Logic Gate Simulator

<iframe src="main.html" height="500px" width="100%" scrolling="no"></iframe>

## Description

This MicroSim provides an interactive environment for exploring the behavior of fundamental logic gates used in digital circuits. Students can select different gate types, toggle input values, and observe the resulting outputs in real-time. The simulator displays both the gate symbol and the complete truth table for each gate type.

Key features:

- **All basic gates**: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR
- **Interactive inputs**: Click to toggle input values between 0 and 1
- **Visual gate symbols**: Standard logic gate shapes with input/output wires
- **Truth table display**: Complete truth table with current state highlighted
- **Multiple inputs**: Support for 2 or 3 input gates

## How to Use

1. **Select a gate** from the dropdown menu
2. **Click the input buttons** (A, B, C) to toggle between 0 and 1
3. **Observe the output** change based on the gate's logic function
4. **Study the truth table** to see all possible input/output combinations
5. **Change input count** to see 2-input or 3-input versions (where applicable)

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Analyze (L4)
**Bloom Verb**: Compare, differentiate, examine

After using this MicroSim, students will be able to:

- Identify the symbols and functions of all basic logic gates
- Predict outputs for any input combination without calculation
- Explain the difference between basic gates (AND, OR) and derived gates (NAND, NOR)
- Describe why NAND and NOR are called "universal gates"
- Compare XOR and XNOR behavior for equality detection

## Lesson Plan

### Before the Simulation (5 minutes)
- Review Boolean algebra basics (AND, OR, NOT operations)
- Discuss how physical circuits represent logic values

### During the Simulation (15 minutes)
1. Start with AND gate: toggle inputs and observe "all inputs must be 1" behavior
2. Switch to OR gate: observe "any input can be 1" behavior
3. Explore NOT gate: single input inversion
4. Compare AND with NAND, OR with NOR
5. Investigate XOR for detecting when inputs differ
6. Try 3-input configurations

### After the Simulation (5 minutes)
- Discuss real-world applications of each gate type
- Introduce the concept of universal gates (NAND, NOR)
