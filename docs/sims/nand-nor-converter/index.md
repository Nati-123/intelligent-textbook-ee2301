# NAND-NOR Converter

Convert Boolean expressions between AND-OR, NAND-only, and NOR-only implementations.

## Overview

This MicroSim converts Boolean expressions between different gate implementations, showing the equivalent circuits using only NAND gates or only NOR gates.

## Learning Objectives

- **Apply** conversion rules to transform expressions (Bloom Level: L3)
- **Analyze** gate count trade-offs between implementations (Bloom Level: L4)

## How to Use

1. **Enter** a Boolean expression (e.g., AB + CD)
2. **View** the AND-OR implementation
3. **See** the equivalent NAND-only circuit
4. **See** the equivalent NOR-only circuit
5. **Compare** gate counts

## Running the MicroSim
