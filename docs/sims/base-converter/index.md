## Description

This MicroSim provides an interactive tool for converting numbers between arbitrary number bases from 2 to 36. It always displays the four primary bases used in digital design — binary (base 2), octal (base 8), decimal (base 10), and hexadecimal (base 16) — plus a user-selectable custom output base. It displays conversions in real-time and shows step-by-step conversion procedures to help students understand the underlying mathematics.

Key features:

- **Arbitrary base support** for any base from 2 to 36 (input and output)
- **Real-time conversion** to all bases as you type
- **Step-by-step display** showing the conversion process
- **Two's complement support** for signed 8-bit numbers
- **Input validation** with helpful error messages

## How to Use

1. **Enter a number** in the input field
2. **Select the input base** from the dropdown (any base from 2 to 36)
3. **Select an output base** to see a custom conversion alongside the four standard bases
4. **View conversions** instantly displayed for binary, octal, decimal, hex, and your custom base
5. **Enable Two's Complement** checkbox to work with signed 8-bit numbers

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Apply (L3)
**Bloom Verb**: Calculate, convert, use

After using this MicroSim, students will be able to:

- Convert numbers between any bases from 2 to 36, including binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal
- Understand positional notation and place values in different bases
- Apply two's complement representation for signed numbers
- Recognize the relationship between binary groupings and hex/octal digits

## Lesson Plan

### Before the Simulation (5 minutes)
- Review positional notation concepts
- Discuss why computers use binary and why hex is convenient for humans

### During the Simulation (10 minutes)
1. Convert a decimal number (e.g., 42) to all other bases
2. Enter a binary number and observe the conversions
3. Enable two's complement mode and enter negative decimal numbers
4. Observe how 8-bit binary representations handle negative values

### After the Simulation (5 minutes)
- Practice mental conversion of small numbers
- Discuss when each base is most useful in practice
