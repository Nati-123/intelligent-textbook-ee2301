## Description

Explore how a BCD to 7-segment decoder works. See which segments light up for each hexadecimal digit and study the Boolean equations for each segment.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Apply (L3)

- Apply decoder design principles
- Understand segment activation patterns
- Relate Boolean equations to display output

## Segment Layout

```
  aaa
 f   b
  ggg
 e   c
  ddd
```

## How to Use

1. Use the slider to select a value (0-F)
2. Observe which segments light up
3. Click "Show Equations" to see simplified Boolean equations
4. Note how each segment output depends on the input bits
