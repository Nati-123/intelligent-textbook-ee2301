# XOR Gate with Truth Table

Interactive XOR (exclusive OR) gate demonstration showing the gate symbol with its distinctive double-curved left edge, clickable inputs, and a complete truth table with the current state highlighted.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to explain the behavior of an XOR gate and predict its output for any combination of inputs.

## Bloom Level

Understand (L2) - Explain, demonstrate

## Features

- XOR gate symbol (OR shape with extra curved line on input side) and input/output wires
- Two clickable toggle buttons to set inputs A and B
- Truth table with current input combination highlighted
- Live Boolean expression evaluation (A ⊕ B = Y)
- Key insight box noting XOR's role in parity checking, adders, and comparators

## Usage

Click the toggle boxes next to inputs A and B to change their values between 0 and 1. The gate output and truth table highlight update in real time.

## Lesson Plan

1. Start with both inputs at 0 - observe output is 0 (inputs are the same)
2. Toggle A to 1 - output becomes 1 (inputs differ)
3. Toggle B to 1 - output returns to 0 (inputs are the same again)
4. Toggle A to 0 - output becomes 1 (inputs differ again)
5. Discuss: XOR detects difference; it is used in parity and addition circuits
