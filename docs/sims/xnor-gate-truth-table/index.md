# XNOR Gate with Truth Table

Interactive XNOR (exclusive NOR) gate demonstration showing the XOR-shaped gate symbol with inversion bubble, clickable inputs, and a complete truth table with the current state highlighted.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to explain the behavior of an XNOR gate and predict its output for any combination of inputs.

## Bloom Level

Understand (L2) - Explain, demonstrate

## Features

- XNOR gate symbol (XOR shape with inversion bubble) and input/output wires
- Two clickable toggle buttons to set inputs A and B
- Truth table with current input combination highlighted
- Live Boolean expression evaluation ((A ⊕ B)' = Y)
- Key insight box noting XNOR's role as an equality detector

## Usage

Click the toggle boxes next to inputs A and B to change their values between 0 and 1. The gate output and truth table highlight update in real time.

## Lesson Plan

1. Start with both inputs at 0 - observe output is 1 (inputs are the same)
2. Toggle A to 1 - output becomes 0 (inputs differ)
3. Toggle B to 1 - output returns to 1 (inputs are the same again)
4. Compare with XOR: XNOR output is always the opposite of XOR
5. Discuss: XNOR detects equality and is used in comparator circuits
