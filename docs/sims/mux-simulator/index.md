# Multiplexer Simulator

An interactive 4-to-1 multiplexer demonstrating data selection based on control signals.

## Overview

This MicroSim demonstrates how a multiplexer selects one of several data inputs and routes it to the output based on the select signal values.

## Learning Objectives

- **Understand** multiplexer operation and data routing (Bloom Level: L2)
- **Apply** select signals to choose specific inputs (Bloom Level: L3)

## How to Use

1. **Toggle** the data inputs D0-D3
2. **Set** the select signals S1, S0
3. **Observe** which input is routed to output Y
4. **View** the truth table highlighting current selection
