## Description

This simulation shows the correspondence between VHDL finite state machine code and its state diagram. Click on states or transitions in either view to see the corresponding element highlighted in both representations.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Analyze (L4)

- Map VHDL FSM code constructs to state diagram elements
- Identify state type declarations, transition logic, and output logic
- Trace state transitions between code and diagram
- Understand the two-process FSM coding pattern

## How to Use

1. Click on a **state** in the diagram to highlight its code
2. Click on a **transition arrow** to see the corresponding WHEN clause
3. Click on **code lines** to highlight the diagram element
4. Use the **Step** button to simulate FSM operation
5. Toggle the **input** to change transition paths
