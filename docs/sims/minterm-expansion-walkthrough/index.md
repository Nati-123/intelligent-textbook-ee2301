## Description

This interactive walkthrough demonstrates how to expand a Boolean expression into its canonical Sum-of-Minterms form. Starting with F(A,B,C) = A'B + BC', each term is expanded to include all variables by multiplying by the appropriate (X + X') = 1 identity.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Apply (L3)

- Apply the minterm expansion technique to convert expressions to canonical form
- Identify missing variables in product terms
- Use the identity (X + X') = 1 to expand terms
- Convert between algebraic and minterm list notation

## How to Use

1. Click **Next →** to advance through each expansion step
2. Watch as each term is identified and expanded
3. See how missing variables are added using (X + X') = 1
4. Observe duplicate minterms being removed
5. Click **← Previous** to review earlier steps
6. Click **Reset** to start over
