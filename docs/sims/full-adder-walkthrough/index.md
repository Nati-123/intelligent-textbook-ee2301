## Description

This interactive walkthrough demonstrates the complete combinational logic design flow by designing a full adder circuit. Starting from the truth table, it derives SOP expressions for Sum and Carry-out, then builds the gate-level circuit.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Apply (L3)

- Apply the combinational design methodology (truth table → SOP → circuit)
- Derive Sum-of-Products expressions from truth tables
- Recognize that Sum = A XOR B XOR Cin
- Build AND-OR gate circuits from SOP expressions

## How to Use

1. Click **Next →** to advance through each design step
2. Watch the truth table rows highlight as minterms are identified
3. See SOP expressions derived and simplified
4. Observe the gate circuit being constructed
5. Click **← Previous** to review earlier steps
6. Click **Reset** to start over
