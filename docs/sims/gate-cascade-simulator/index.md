<iframe src="main.html" height="550px" width="100%" scrolling="no"></iframe>


## Description

Explore multi-level logic circuits and observe signal propagation through cascaded gates. Toggle inputs to see how signals flow through each stage.

## Learning Objectives

**Bloom Level**: Analyze (L4)

- Trace signal propagation through multi-level circuits
- Analyze how intermediate gate outputs affect final results
- Compare different circuit implementations

## Circuits Included

1. **(A AND B) OR C** - Two-level AND-OR
2. **A AND (B OR C)** - Two-level OR-AND
3. **(A NAND B) AND C** - NAND cascade
4. **NOT(A) OR (B AND C)** - Three gates
5. **(A XOR B) AND C** - XOR cascade

## How to Use

1. Select a circuit from the dropdown
2. Click the A, B, C toggles to change input values
3. Observe how signals propagate through each gate
4. Note the color coding: green for 1, gray for 0
