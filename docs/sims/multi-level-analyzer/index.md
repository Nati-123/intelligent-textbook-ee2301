# Multi-Level Circuit Analyzer

Analyze propagation delay and critical paths in multi-level logic circuits.

## Overview

This MicroSim helps visualize how signals propagate through multi-level circuits and identifies the critical path that determines maximum circuit speed.

## Learning Objectives

- **Analyze** propagation delay accumulation in multi-level circuits (Bloom Level: L4)
- **Evaluate** critical path impact on circuit performance (Bloom Level: L5)

## How to Use

1. **Select** a circuit configuration
2. **Set** individual gate delays
3. **Watch** signal propagation animation
4. **Identify** the critical path (highlighted in red)
5. **Read** the total propagation delay

## Running the MicroSim
