Interactive buffer gate demonstration showing the triangle gate symbol (without inversion bubble), a clickable input, and a complete truth table with the current state highlighted.

## Learning Objective

Students will be able to explain the behavior of a buffer gate and understand its practical purpose despite having no logical transformation.

## Bloom Level

Understand (L2) - Explain, demonstrate

## Features

- Buffer gate symbol (triangle without bubble) and input/output wires
- Single clickable toggle button to set input A
- Two-row truth table with current input highlighted
- Live Boolean expression evaluation (Y = A)
- Key insight box explaining signal amplification, isolation, and timing delay uses

## Usage

Click the toggle box next to input A to change its value between 0 and 1. The gate output and truth table highlight update in real time.

## Lesson Plan

1. Start with input at 0 - observe output is 0 (same as input)
2. Toggle A to 1 - output becomes 1 (same as input)
3. Compare with NOT gate: buffer looks similar but has no bubble
4. Discuss: why use a buffer if it doesn't change the signal?
5. Explain practical uses: signal amplification, isolation between circuit stages, and timing delays
