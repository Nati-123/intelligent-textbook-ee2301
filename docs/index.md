# Intelligent Textbook for EE Students — Digital System Design

**Senior Design Project • University of Minnesota – Twin Cities**
**Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering**

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an AI-assisted intelligent interactive textbook for the course:

**Introduction to Digital System Design**

The goal is to build a modern, accessible textbook that uses AI tools (Claude Code) to provide:

- Original, student-friendly explanations
- Step-by-step derivations of key concepts
- Worked examples with solutions
- Visual learning aids (logic diagrams, truth tables, K-maps, etc.)
- Auto-generated practice problems
- Instant interactive solutions
- Adaptive learning features powered by Claude Code

This project supports students who want clearer explanations than traditional textbooks and provides practice material aligned with UMN course outcomes.

## Goals & Objectives

1. Develop high-quality original learning materials for EE 2301.
2. Use Claude Code to generate structured, consistent, and copyright-safe content.
3. Provide interactive examples and auto-graded problem sets.
4. Build a searchable, online-friendly textbook hosted on GitHub.
5. Improve learning accessibility for future EE students.
