## About This Project

This project demonstrates how AI can augment educational content creation while maintaining pedagogical quality. All content follows Bloom's Taxonomy (2001) for learning outcomes and is structured around a 225-concept learning graph with explicit dependencies.

**Built with:**

- [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) — Documentation framework
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) — AI-assisted content generation
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) — Interactive simulations
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) — Mathematical notation
