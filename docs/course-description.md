## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of digital system design. Students will learn how digital circuits process information using binary number systems and Boolean algebra. The course covers the mathematical foundations, analysis techniques, and design methodologies essential for creating both combinational and sequential digital logic circuits.

Topics progress from number representations through Boolean algebra to systematic methods for designing and simplifying logic circuits. Students will gain hands-on experience with truth tables, logic gates, Karnaugh maps, the Quine-McCluskey method, multi-level gate implementations, combinational modules, and sequential circuit design including latches, flip-flops, registers, counters, and finite state machines.
