## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of digital system design. Students will learn how digital circuits process information using binary number systems and Boolean algebra. The course covers the mathematical foundations, analysis techniques, and design methodologies essential for creating digital logic circuits.

Topics progress from number representations through Boolean algebra to systematic methods for designing and simplifying combinational logic circuits. Students will gain hands-on experience with truth tables, logic gates, Karnaugh maps, and canonical forms used in modern digital design.
