## Project Overview

This project aims to create an AI-assisted intelligent interactive textbook for the course:

**EE 2301: Introduction to Digital System Design**

The goal is to build a modern, accessible textbook that uses AI tools (Claude Code) to provide:

- Original, student-friendly explanations  
- Step-by-step derivations of key concepts  
- Worked examples with solutions  
- Visual learning aids (logic diagrams, truth tables, K-maps, etc.)  
- Auto-generated practice problems  
- Instant interactive solutions  
- Adaptive learning features powered by Claude Code  

This project supports students who want clearer explanations than traditional textbooks and provides practice material aligned with UMN course outcomes.
