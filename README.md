 Project Overview

This project aims to create an AI-assisted intelligent interactive textbook for the course:

 Introduction to Digital System Design

The goal is to build a modern, accessible textbook that uses AI tools (Claude Code) to provide:

Original, student-friendly explanations

Step-by-step derivations of key concepts

Worked examples with solutions

Visual learning aids (logic diagrams, truth tables, K-maps, etc.)

Auto-generated practice problems

Instant interactive solutions

Adaptive learning features (powered by Claude Code)

This project supports students who want clearer explanations than those found in traditional textbooks and provides practice material that aligns with UMN course outcomes.

 Goals & Objectives

Develop high-quality original learning materials for EE 2301

Use Claude Code to generate structured, consistent, and copyright-safe content

Provide interactive examples and auto-graded problem sets

Build a searchable, online-friendly textbook hosted on GitHub

Improve learning accessibility for future EE students

Scope of the Textbook (Units Included)

This project covers the core units of EE 2301:

Unit 1 — Number Systems

Unit 2 — Boolean Algebra

Unit 3 — Applications of Boolean Algebra

Unit 4 — Minterm & Maxterm Expansions (SOP/POS)

Unit 5 — Karnaugh Maps
