🎓 Excited to announce the completion of my Senior Design Project: an **AI-Assisted Intelligent Textbook** for Digital System Design!

This interactive online textbook for EE 2301 (Introduction to Digital System Design) was built using Claude Code and MkDocs Material, demonstrating how AI can augment educational content creation while maintaining pedagogical quality.

📊 **By the Numbers:**
• 10 comprehensive units
• 55 interactive MicroSims (p5.js simulations)
• 200 practice problems with detailed solutions
• 108 quiz questions
• 225 glossary terms (ISO 11179 compliant)
• 63 FAQs

📚 **Topics Covered:**
• Number Systems & Binary Arithmetic
• Boolean Algebra & Logic Gates
• Karnaugh Maps & Quine-McCluskey
• Combinational Logic (MUX, Decoders, Encoders)
• Sequential Logic (Flip-Flops, Counters, FSMs)

🎮 **Interactive Learning:**
Students can explore concepts through hands-on MicroSims including logic gate simulators, K-map solvers, flip-flop visualizers, and FSM designers—all running directly in the browser.

## Post Option 3: Story-Focused

What if textbooks could be more than PDFs?

For my Senior Design Project at the University of Minnesota, I built an intelligent interactive textbook for Digital System Design using AI.

The result:
✅ 55 interactive simulations (logic gates, K-maps, flip-flops, FSMs)
✅ 200 practice problems with step-by-step solutions
✅ 108 self-assessment quizzes
✅ 225-term glossary

Students don't just read about flip-flops—they click, toggle, and see timing diagrams update in real-time.

This project showed me how AI tools like Claude Code can help create educational content that's consistent, comprehensive, and actually engaging.
