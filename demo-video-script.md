## Recording Tips

### Before Recording
- [ ] Test all MicroSims you'll demo (make sure they load)
- [ ] Practice the script 2-3 times
- [ ] Check audio levels
- [ ] Close unnecessary applications
- [ ] Set browser zoom to 110-125%

### During Recording
- [ ] Speak slowly and clearly
- [ ] Pause for 1-2 seconds between sections
- [ ] Move mouse smoothly (not too fast)
- [ ] If you make a mistake, pause and restart that section

### After Recording
- [ ] Trim dead air at beginning/end
- [ ] Add background music (optional, keep it subtle)
- [ ] Add captions if possible (improves accessibility)
- [ ] Export at 1080p, 30fps

### Recommended Software
| Task | Tool |
|------|------|
| Screen Recording | OBS Studio (free), Loom, QuickTime |
